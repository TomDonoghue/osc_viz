# Oscillation Visualization Project

This is a simple EEG visualization project, created as a project for the Information Visualization Class at UC San Diego. It uses DS3 (javascript) to create a set of basic, interactive, visualizations for EEG data. 

The project is viewable here: http://icogsci1.ucsd.edu/~tdonoghu/

Disclaimer:
- This project is pretty old, and I'm not a js or D3 expert, so although it all works, no guarantees that it is done in any clever ways, or using best practices.
